        <h1>FIAT South America</h1>
        <p>Fiat has invested for a long time in South America, mainly in Brazil (where has been the market leader for many years) and in Argentina. They built their first Brazilian car plant in the Greater Belo Horizonte city of Betim in 1973, after having begun by building tractors there.
                
            The Brazilian range is similar to European one, with the addition of a special family which derives from a common platform (called "Project 178"): Palio Weekend, Palio Adventure, Strada.
                
                Recently a range of new models developed in Brazil has been launched: Uno, Palio, Grand Siena, Fiorino.
                
                Other European models are currently imported to Brazil: Fiat 500.</p>
